# Ncurses-applications
Some games that I made using C language and Ncurses library. 
I will make a new version of each one but not yet, I uploaded these games to remind me how I coded when I was a noob programmer.
To compile the .c files you must have ncurses library installed and type:
  gcc example.c -o example -lncurses
Note: example is the program name.
